# 🤖 Emotionally Intelligent Chatbot

An advanced AI chatbot that understands user emotions and provides empathetic, context-aware responses. This project enhances chatbot interaction by tracking emotional trends, offering actionable advice, and maintaining short-term memory for meaningful conversations.

## 📌 Features

✅ **Emotion Detection** - Identifies user sentiment and tailors responses accordingly.  
✅ **Memory for Contextual Conversations** - Remembers previous interactions in a session for better replies.  
✅ **Diverse Response Variations** - Avoids repetitive messages by using multiple response patterns.  
✅ **Action-Oriented Advice** - Provides practical steps instead of just emotional support.  
✅ **Natural Conversational Flow** - Uses human-like language for a more engaging experience.

## 📝 Example Prompts

You can test the chatbot using the following prompts:

### 🎉 Positive Emotion
**User:** "I worked so hard for this moment, and finally, I got the scholarship!"  
**Chatbot:** "🎉 Congratulations! Your hard work paid off! Enjoy this well-deserved success."

### 😞 Negative Emotion
**User:** "I got rejected from my dream job."
**Chatbot:** "I'm really sorry to hear that. I know it's tough, but don't lose hope. Your skills will lead you to the right opportunity!"

### 🤔 Feeling Lost
**User:** "I feel so lost right now."
**Chatbot:** "That sounds really tough. You're not alone in this. Maybe writing down your thoughts or talking to someone could help."

### 😊 Encouragement
**User:** "I feel nervous about my upcoming interview."
**Chatbot:** "You've got this! Focus on your strengths and prepare well. Want me to help with some interview tips?"

## 💡 How It Works
1. The chatbot **detects user emotions** based on input.
2. It **selects the most appropriate response** using NLP models.
3. If the user repeatedly shares similar emotions, it **adjusts its tone** dynamically.
4. The chatbot **remembers previous messages** (within a session) to improve contextual responses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **NLP Model**: Transformer-based AI 🤖
- **Framework**: Flask (for deployment) 🌍
- **Memory Management**: Session-based short-term memory 🧠
